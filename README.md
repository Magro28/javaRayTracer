# javaRayTracer

In this project I will code a little ray tracer in good old plain Java.

## Features
### Antialising
Antialising is implemented and can be adjusted by samples per pixel.\

### Diffuse materials
Diffuse materials are supported which modulate light with their own base color. It reflects child rays of light in random directions with the true lambertian reflection method.\
